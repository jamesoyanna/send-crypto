## Send Crypto Application

### About Project
Send crypto is a blockchain application, metamask pairing, interaction with smart contract built with solidity, allowing the sending of ethereum through the blockchain network.

## Application Features
- Connect regular react js application into the blockchain
- pair it to an Ethereum wallet using Metamask.
- Smart contract with solidity

## How it works:
- The application allows users to make a transaction through the blockchain.

-Each transaction is paired with an image and it is stored on the blockchain.

When a user clicks on the connect to wallet button, it will immediately trigger a connection to the Metamask wallet, and it will request the account you want to connect to.

- Connection to a meta mask account - You will automatically see a display of the connected wallet address on the Ethereum card.

- You can switch your account to another account you want to send Ethereum to from the Metamask wallet.

- Input your wallet address on the transaction area. Specify the amount of Ethereum you want to send, add a keyword you would want to use and a message then click on Send Now

- Metamask automatically prompts a message describing the amount to be sent.

-Click on confirm then a second notification will appear which is the contract interaction.
